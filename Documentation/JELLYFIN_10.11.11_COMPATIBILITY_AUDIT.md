# Jellyfin 10.11.11 Compatibility Audit

## Scope and method

This audit covers the current dashboard configuration build. Each Jellyfin
surface was checked against the local read-only Jellyfin Plugin Base and the
local official Jellyfin Web v10.11.11 source checkout before implementation.

Primary official references:

- [BasePlugin<TConfiguration>](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/v10.11.11/MediaBrowser.Common/Plugins/BasePluginOfT.cs)
- [PluginPageInfo](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/v10.11.11/MediaBrowser.Model/Plugins/PluginPageInfo.cs)
- [HomeSectionType](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web/blob/v10.11.11/src/types/homeSectionType.ts)
- [Home screen settings](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web/blob/v10.11.11/src/components/homeScreenSettings/homeScreenSettings.js)
- [User display preferences](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web/blob/v10.11.11/src/scripts/settings/userSettings.js)
- [Branding and Custom CSS](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web/blob/v10.11.11/src/apps/dashboard/routes/branding/index.tsx)
- [Server plugin-page loading](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web/blob/v10.11.11/src/components/ServerContentPage.tsx)
- [Plugin-page HTML translation](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web/blob/v10.11.11/src/lib/globalize/index.js)

## Checked plugin and dashboard contracts

| Surface | Checked implementation | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime ABI | Targets net9.0 and references Jellyfin.Controller and Jellyfin.Model 10.11.11, with runtime assets excluded. | Release build passes. |
| Identity and configuration | Plugin derives from BasePlugin of PluginConfiguration and declares one stable plugin ID. | Supported. |
| Dashboard/sidebar page | IHasWebPages, embedded configPage.html, and PluginPageInfo.EnableInMainMenu provide the Dashboard entry. | Supported; live render still requires server testing. |
| Plugin-page translation | Jellyfin Web passes server-provided plugin HTML through globalize.translateHtml, where literal dollar-brace tokens are translation placeholders. The embedded page contains no JavaScript template interpolation tokens. | Supported translation-safe page source. |
| Current Jellyfin sections | Reads getDisplayPreferences('usersettings', userId, 'emby') and the official homesection0 through homesection9 custom preferences. Empty values use Jellyfin's official default-section sequence. | Supported read path. |
| Native section names | Maps only the official 10.11.11 HomeSectionType values. | Supported. |
| Saved plugin drafts | Elevated plugin controller routes persist only plugin configuration: label colors, hybrid order, section type, source IDs, and manual item IDs. | Supported plugin-owned configuration. |
| Jellyfin media previews | Uses the official current-user Items query with ParentId, Recursive, StartIndex, and Limit, continuing through TotalRecordCount. | Supported read path. |
| Custom CSS | Reads `Branding/Configuration` and updates `System/Configuration/Branding` through Jellyfin Web 10.11.11 authenticated `ApiClient`. Unrelated CSS and branding fields are preserved. | Supported administrator path; live application still requires server testing. |
| Collection/tag pickers | Reuses the installed Collection Manager plugin's existing settings, art-collection, manual-item, metadata-catalog, and preview routes. | Supported by the required companion plugin; version-pair testing required. |

## Explicit current boundary

This release configures and restores section drafts only. It does not inject
JavaScript into Jellyfin Web, patch Jellyfin files, replace Jellyfin's ten
native preferences, or render plugin sections on the home screen. The native
and plugin row order saved here is plugin-owned planning state for the later
renderer.

No media metadata, collection membership, NFO file, media file, or library
configuration is changed by the section-design interface.

## Remaining runtime evidence

Source review, JavaScript parsing, Release compilation, catalog checksum
validation, and archive inspection are separate from installed behavior. The
real Jellyfin 10.11.11 checks remain in
[goal-testing.txt](goal-testing.txt) and must be recorded before any dashboard
behavior is described as runtime-verified.
